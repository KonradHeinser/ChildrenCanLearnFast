Simple mod that makes it so children learning rate is affected by the slow study and quick study genes. Both have a 50% impact, similar to the skill learning rate. I also made [url=https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2977564653]a mod that makes traits[/url] affect learning rate, which I kept separate because they can create a stronger affect than some would like. For example, a child with the Slow Study Gene and the Slow Learner Trait only has a 12% learning rate factor with both mods.
